                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                server.

            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p> 
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
            </p>

        <article>
            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.

                The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Boolean. true and false.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                      JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                      NULL, or any other variant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Number. 42 or 3.14159.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      String. "Howdy"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                      are unique and immutable.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                      and Object
